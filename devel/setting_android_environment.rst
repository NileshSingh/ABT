Introduction
------------------
In this tutorial, we show you how to setting Aakash Business Tool(ABT) application 
in Eclipse IDE + ADT plugin, and run it with Android Virtual Device (AVD). 
Developing an application on **Aakash**, the basic software platform
utilised was Eclipse (Indigo).  The Android Version 4.0 was the
supporting version to develop.

Setting up the Android Envionment
--------------------------------------------------
+ **Android SDK**
	
	* The Android SDK provides a set of tools and APIs to develop Android applications, using Java.
	
	* Download the android SDK from the official website 
	  `developer.android.com <http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html>`_
	
	* The basic command for ubuntu users to check their configured version is 
	
		::

	   		uname -a
	   		
	* Type the command on the terminal and check for the system is 64 or 32 bit. 
	  The linux users should install the proper version, as there is availabilty of two versions 64 and 32 bit.
	
	* Please remember that currently adb only supports 32-bit system, 
	  if your system is 64-bit, then install ``ia32-libs-multiarch`` library to support multi-architecture. 
	  On Ubuntu system, install ``ia32-libs-multiarch`` using 
	  
		::

	   		sudo apt-get install ia32-libs-multiarch


+ **Installing the Packages in SDK Manager**
	
	* Configure the SDK manager and download tools and packages for different Android versions.
	
	* For example the Android 2.2 (froyo), Android 2.3
          (ginerbread), Android 3.0 or 3.1 (honeycomb), Android 4.0
          (ice cream sandwich) and so on.

	* ``Note``: Before starting the package downloading process, 
	  apply net settings in the Android SDK Manager, 
	  select ``Tools`` > ``Options`` and configure the internet settings.

+ **Software platform- Eclipse(Indigo)**
	
	* The basic software platform to develop an application is to install Eclipse.
	
	* Download eclipse package from the official website for 
	  `eclipse <http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/>`_.

	* or Linux users can install eclipse by typing a command,
		::

	   		sudo apt-get install eclipse

	* `Note`: we have used Eclipse version 3.7.2(Indigo), even Eclipse
	  4.x(Juno) is fine to work with.

+ **Install ADT Eclipse plugin**

  Android offers a custom plugin for the Eclipse IDE, called Android Development Tools (ADT). 
  The Eclipse ADT plugin provided easy Android project creation and management, components drag and drop, 
  auto-complete and many useful features to speed up your Android development cycles. 
  To integrate Android SDK with Eclipse IDE, you need to install Eclipse ADT plugin. 
  Refer to this official guide â€“ `Installing the ADT Plugin 
  <http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/eclipse-adt.html#installing>`_.
	
	
	* **Setups for configuring** :
			
    	  `Note`: before starting the ADT plugin process (if installing from
          the internet), apply net settings in the Eclipse, select Windows >
          Preferences . On General option , click on Network and configure the
          internet settings.

    	  - Start Eclipse, select Help > Check for updates.
  
    	  - then select Help > Install New Software.
			
    	  - Click Add, in the top-right corner.
			
   	  - In the Add Repository dialog that appears, enter "ADT Plugin" for
            the Name and the following URL for the location
            `https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/ <https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/>`_
			
    	  - Click OK. `Note`, If you have trouble acquiring the plugin, try
            using ``http`` in the Location URL, instead of ``https`` (``https`` is
      	    preferred for security reasons).
			
   	  - In the Available Software dialog, select the checkbox next to
            Developer Tools and click Next.
			
    	  - In the next window, you'll see a list of the tools to be
            downloaded. Click Next.
			
    	  - Read and accept the license agreements, then click Finish.
			
    	  - When the installation completes, restart Eclipse.


	* **Configure the ADT Plugin**
  
    	  - After you've installed ADT and restarted Eclipse, you must specify
      	    the location of your Android SDK directory.

    	  - Select Window > Preferences... to open the Preferences panel (on Mac
      	    OS X, select Eclipse > Preferences).

    	  - Select Android from the left panel.

    	  - For the SDK Location in the main panel, click Browse... and locate
      	    your downloaded Android SDK directory (such as android-sdk-windows).

    	  - Click Apply, then OK.



+ **Create an Android Virtual Device(AVD)**
	
	* In Eclipse, you can access the ``Android Virtual Device (AVD)`` in Eclipse toolbar.
	
	* Create a new avd in AVD manager and mention proper memory size of 
	  the SDcard and launch the emulator.


+ **Clone APK**
	
	* Android(4.0.3, API-15) code for user interface of Aakash Business Tool is 
	  located at `github <https://github.com/androportal/ABT>`_.

	* User can clone this repo by typing command,
		::

	   		git clone https://github.com/androportal/ABT.git

	* **ics** is the default branch. If you want to clone code from specific branch, type
		::

		   	git clone -b branch_name https://github.com/androportal/ABT.git

+ **Import ABT project in eclipse**

  After cloning the required branch, start eclipse

	* Go to ``File`` menu > ``Import``.
		
	* From the ``Import`` dialog box, select ``Android``.
		
	* From ``Android`` section, select ``Existing Android Code Into Workspace`` 
	  and click ``Next`` button.
 		    
	* You will be taken to ``Import Projects`` dialog box, click ``Browse`` button 
	  and select the cloned repository.
	

How to start ABT
----------------

+ **Run on a Real Device**

  Before running ABT make sure that ABTcore is started and not inside an exception. 
  To start the server, go through chapter `2.3.2. On Aakash Device(ARM-arch) 
  <backend_server.html#on-aakash-device-arm-arch>`_. 
  
  If you have a real Android-powered device, here's how you can install and run ABT. 
  Plug in your device to your development machine with a USB cable. 
  Enable USB debugging on your device.
  
  To run the app from Eclipse:
  
  	- Open one of ABT project's files and click Run from the toolbar.
    
  	- In the Run as window that appears, select Android Application and click OK.
    
 	- Eclipse installs the app on your connected device and starts it.

   


+ **Run on the Emulator**

  Before running ABT make sure that ABTcore is started and not inside an  exception. 
  To start the server, go through chapter `2.3.1. On Ubuntu machine <backend_server.html#id1>`_. 
  
  **Important note:** To test Aakash Business Tool on emulator, go to

   * ``ABT/src/com/gkaakash/coreconection/CoreConnection.java`` and
     change the url from ``http://127.0.0.1:7081`` to ``http://10.0.2.2:7081``
     
   * ``ABT/src/com/example/gkaakash/MainActivity``, comment line
     no. 88 and 128. Basically you need to comment ``help_popup()``
     function on both lines.
	
   * ``ABT/src/com/example/gkaakash/createOrg``, comment line no. 59
     and 60. You need to comment below two line ::

    	MainActivity.no_dailog = true;
    	MainActivity.help_dialog.dismiss();

   * ``ABT/src/com/example/gkaakash/selectOrg``, comment line
     no. 43, which is ::
     
     	MainActivity.no_dailog = true;
  
  Whether you're using Eclipse or the command line, to run ABT on the emulator 
  you need to first start AVD. After the emulator boots up, unlock the emulator screen.

  To run the app from Eclipse:

 	- Open one of ABT project's files and click Run from the toolbar.
     
  	- In the Run as window that appears, select Android Application and click OK.

     	- Eclipse installs the app on your AVD(emulator) and starts it.
